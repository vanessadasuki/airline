The objective of this project is to investigate passengers’ behavior based on the airport choice and the airline choice. This project aims to develop models to describe passenger’s airline and airport choice behavior using model implementation and model evaluation, as well as describing passengers’ behavior based on the modeling result. To analyze these choices, we apply several behavior approaches to modeling air travel behavior using discrete choice modeling or data mining modeling. Additionally, we will be also assessing substantive policy implications based on the quantitative analysis.
